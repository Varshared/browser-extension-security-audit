   - Looked up extensions on the official web store for user reviews and developer credibility.

4. **Identified Unused or Suspicious Extensions**
   - No unknown or unused extensions were found.
   - All extensions in use are necessary and regularly used.

5. **Removed Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions**
   - *No extensions were removed.*
